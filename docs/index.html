                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>I'm Shiv Vyasâ€”IoT Engineer, Data Scientist, and (as Barney Stinson would say) wait for it... a start-up founder who discovered that designing affordable vehicle security systems can be so secure, they even lock out success! But every great journey has its plot twists, and mine is filled with algorithms and ambition.</p>

                <p>My passion lies in developing intelligent systems that make a real-world impact. Whether I'm crafting AI models or strategizing in chess, I love playing with algorithms and pushing technological boundaries.</p>

                <p>Ever wondered why we don't use light as a backup communication method in space for astronauts and rovers, or how tweaks in human-machine interfaces could end pandemics or prevent future ones? These are the intriguing questions that fuel my curiosity and drive my work.</p>

                <p>Fueled by tea and a love for Python, and as a believer in Carl Sagan's words, "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known," I'm on a constant quest for innovation that can change the world.</p>

                <p>If you're intrigued by cutting-edge technology, cosmic ideas, or just appreciate a good laugh at entrepreneurial adventures, I invite you to explore my portfolio where curiosity meets innovation.</p>

                <p><strong>P.S. I'm a bad web developer, so if something doesn't load... it's not a bug; it's a feature!</strong></p>
